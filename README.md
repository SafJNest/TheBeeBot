# ***THE BEEBOX***

![ffewfe](/rsc/img/logo.png)

## ***Overview (≧ڡ≦*)***
This Discord bot is designed to enhance your server experience by providing a range of features, including music playback, custom sound uploading, server management commands, server stats tracking, and commands for the popular game League of Legends. ;D.
##
In addition, the developers have also created two additional bots, Beebot 2 and Beebot Music, to provide even more versatility. Beebot 2 is identical to Beebot, allowing users to utilize multiple bots on the same server, while Beebot Music is a lightweight version that only includes the music commands. These additional bots provide users with more options to customize their Discord server and tailor the bot's functionality to their specific needs.

## ***Functionality***

### **Music Playback**
The bot comes with a built-in music player that allows you to play songs directly in your voice channel. You can use commands to search for songs on YouTube or SoundCloud, add them to a playlist, skip tracks, adjust volume, and more. You can even queue up multiple playlists for uninterrupted listening sessions.

### **Custom Sound Uploading**
In addition to the built-in music player, the bot also lets you upload your own custom sounds to use in your server. You can use this feature to add unique sound effects, music clips, or voice lines that are specific to your server or community.

### **Server Management Commands**
The bot includes several server management commands that allow you to manage your server more easily. You can use commands to create custom roles, ban or kick users, clear channels, set up auto-moderation, and more.

### **Server Stats Tracking**
The bot also provides several server stats tracking features, such as user activity tracking, channel usage stats, and more. You can use these stats to gain insights into how your server is being used and make informed decisions about how to improve it.

### **League of Legends Commands**
Finally, the bot includes several commands related to the popular game League of Legends. You can use these commands to get information about summoner stats, match history, item builds, and more. This feature is particularly useful if you have a gaming community that plays League of Legends and wants to stay up-to-date with the latest information.
